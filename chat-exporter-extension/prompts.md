I want to make a chrome extension to help me export my chats from google scholar labs, this is the html structure:


google scholar labs is meant for deep search, not deep research so it returns a list of academic papers, usefule for quick research. I want to export everything in the form of a markdown file does this make sense, please make this chrome extension as minimal as possible with the modularity to be able to export conversations from other chat apps in the future, for now just make (google scholar search labs) component


I have the following chrome extension for exporting chat conversations, i want to extend it to be able to be used with claude. I want to make it modular so that i can add other chat apps in the future, also, i don't want to have a popup, i just want to be able to click the extension in my extension bar and have it not even pop up just automatically know which type of chat to export, does this make sense? I will provide a sample claude conversation so you know what elements to look for and export all of them:


i don't have any icons for this project, please remove icons code from manifest.json and more...
